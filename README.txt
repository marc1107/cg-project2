The project shows a 3D scene with a chair, a table and a chess board on the table.
By using the clipX variable which is used in the position of the chair, the chair can be moved.
When the chair is at the table, it won't move further.

All the objects are made with cuboids as polyhedra.
The chess board is one cuboid, the table has a top cuboid and one as a leg.
The chair has a seat, a back and four legs.

To interact with the chair we implemented 2 buttons which move the chair to and from the table.

All the objects have their own textures.
The textures are loaded in the HTML file and then used in the JavaScript file by using the document.getElementById() function.
